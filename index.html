                [hey my love,see how far we have come together with all ups and downs. With all smile,laughter,jokes, cries, , sorrows and pain.It was not easy but we made it possible because of our love and i know whatever life throws on us will fight it back together. You have been always special for me  from the day u met and u will be always special for me till my last breathe.You changed my life, gave me joy and love that i was missing. Nothing is bigger or important than the love snd care you give me. Even if my eyes gets close, you will remain in my heart for eternal.]

            <p>Yours forever,</p>
